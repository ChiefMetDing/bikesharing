## Overview
The analysis processed Citibike's bike sharing data obtained in August 2019 in New York City. The purpose of the analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, giving the fact that both cities are similar in the following ways:

- Are on the planet Earth;
- Have citizens know how to ride a bike;
- Have roads and streets.

## Results
### Starting and Ending Locations
It is interesting to see that during weekdays peak hours, the ending locations in the afternoons are very close to the starting locations in the mornings. Same way, the ending locations in the mornings are very close to the starting locations in the afternoons. This suggests that the OPEX spent on relocating bikes during weekdays is low, because people tend to ride to work and ride back from work.
